http1.1
req and response sequentially in one long connection, head-of-line blocking
inefficent header


http2
binary encoding
connection multiplexed, resource fetch in parallel
  one tls connection shared by streams
  stream composed of frames and is bi-directional
    header frame
    data frame
    continuation frame
    ...
  stream could has priority and dependency
  stream cloud be closed without affect others
  stream has its own flow control
server push
header compression: 
  keep already known table
  repeated element just use pointer/reference

client                            server
            headers ->
            <- headers 
            <- continuation
            <- data
            <- headers 
            <- continuation

binary format:
