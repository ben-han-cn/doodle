Commonly, there are two distinct layers in the inbound packet path:

IP firewall
network stack
These are conceptually distinct. The IP firewall is usually a stateless piece 
of software (let's ignore conntrack and IP fragment reassembly for now). The 
firewall analyzes IP packets and decides whether to ACCEPT or DROP them. 
Please note: at this layer we are talking about packets and port numbers - 
not applications or sockets.

Then there is the network stack. This beast maintains plenty of state. Its main 
task is to dispatch inbound IP packets into sockets, which are then handled by 
userspace applications. The network stack manages abstractions which are shared 
with userspace. It reassembles TCP flows, deals with routing, and knows which 
IP addresses are local.
