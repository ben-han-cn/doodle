key problems:

where to put code
The role of each object in a big system?
messy base class

object is very hard to design very condense/coherent:
    all the function works on a common set of data
big data is very cach unfriendly, since some method only needs
part of the data.

ns -> 100ns -> 150 000 -> 150 000 000

base object --> first level object
add new abstraction to struct without new attribute/state
abstract algorithm instead of object
make algorithm composable

data driven design:
    concentrate on data transformation
