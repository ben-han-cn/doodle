    associative

    a neutral elements

instance (Monoid a, Monoid b) => Monoid (a, b)
instance (Monoid b) => Monoid (a -> b)

endomorphism:
    a function with return a value of the same 
type as its input argument
    f :: a -> a
    the composition of such method is a monoid.


bifunctor
    a container that can be translated over tow dimensions (independently of each other)
    a functor can be translated over a single dimensions

Isomorphism
is a mapping for which an inverse mapping also exists. It's a way to describe equivalence.
(tuple is isomorphism to struct)

curry :: ((a, b) -> c) -> a -> b -> c
uncurry :: (a -> b -> c) -> (a, b) -> c
