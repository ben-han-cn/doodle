lambda
𝜆x.x+1 (head . body)
only accpet one paremter 
application == redution, binding value to paremeter(sustitude x with value)

𝜆x.xy, x is bound variable which is named in the header, y is free variable 
multiply parameter means nested lambda
𝜆xy.xy == 𝜆x.(𝜆y.xy) 

combinator is lambda without free variable
divergence means lambda reduction process will never terminates or ends

haskell is a implementation of lambda

(->) is a function's type constructor, it has no value constructor

where / let is different

operator == function with infix position


polymorphism

ad-hoc(constrained)
  interface
  typeclass
paramatic
  template
  type variable


data constructor == value (only way to express value except the basic/primary types)

a is isomorphic to b ==  a -> b , b -> a without lose information

term -> type -> kind
type has term is inhabited type, 
maybe isnot inhabited type, they are type constructors.
kind is the way to distinguish the difference between these types.
    kind of inhabited type is * 

data Either a b = Left a | Right b
Either is type constructor, kind of Either is * -> * -> *
Left and Right are data constructor

HOF(high order funciton) function which accept or return other function
HKT(high kinded types) type constructor which accept other type constructor
    data NoEmpty f a = MKNoEmpty { head :: a, tail :: f a}

box(lifted)/unboxed(unlifted) type
    normal type is boxed
    Int#, Char# is unlifted, these type is used to notify compiler to optimize there memory representation.

Kind ploymorphism
    data Proxy a = MkProxy (a here is inferred as inhabited type, it couldn't be Maybe)
use language extension to support
{-# LANGUAGE PolyKinds #-}
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}
data Proxy (a :: k) = MkProxy
