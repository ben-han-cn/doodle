complicated pointers
For a misbehaved c++ program, sometimes it's very hard to debug 
One reason for this is that some pointer operation overwrite the data
of another class or struct which make the state of the system very subtle.
Pointers are just integers, but just because two pointers point to the same
address (with same value), doesn't mean they are equal and can be used 
interchangeably
