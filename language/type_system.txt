subtype
    Cat -> Mammal (Cat -> Mammal)

substitution priciple(SP)
    if S -> T, it means that any term of type S can be safely
used in a context where a term of type T is expected.

variance:
    how subtypeing between the types affect subtypeing between the compostion type 
    wrapping them

    if S -> T:
    Covariant:      Composite<S> -> Composite<T>
    Contravariant:  Composite<T> -> Composite<S>
    Bivariant:      Covariant and Contravariant
    Invariant:      !Covariant and !Contravariant

Composite type: Container(Vector, Map), function
