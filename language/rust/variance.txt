variance is a property of the type-constructors (build type with type parameter).
If type-constructors has multiple parameters, then variance is computed with respect
to each parameter individually.

Three type of variance:
F<T> is covariant over T if F<Subtype> is subtype of F<Supertype>
F<T> is contravariant over T if F<Subtype> is supertype of F<Supertype>
F<T> is invariant over T if F<Subtype> is neither a subtype nor a supertype of F<Supertype>

for lifetime 'a, if 'a is subtype of 'b means, 'a is longer than 'b, 'static is the subtype
of all lifetime
