It is by apply abstraction, then, that we are able to contruct, analyze and
manage large, complex computer systems, which would be overwhelming if viewed
in their entirely at detailed leve. At each level of abstraction, we view the
system in terms of components, called abstract tools, whose internal composition
we ignore. This allow us to concentrate on how each component interacts with other
components at the same level and how the collection as a whole forms a higher-level
componenet. Thus we are able to comprehend the part of the system that is relevant 
to the task at hand rather than being lost in a sea of details.

Algorithm has the central role in computer science:
limitations of algorithm
execution of algorithm
communication of algorithm
representation of algorithm
discovery of algorithm
analysis of algorithm
application of algorithm

language performance:
interpeter  ---> native code 
    AOT, JIT
static      ---> dynamic type system 
    type could be infered by compiler, or has to be checked at runtime

function dispatch
memory allocation, pointer redirection
abstract, concrete type and type parameter
type and memory management
macro and function inline

data locality
array of struct(AOS) vs struct of array(SOA)

struct Person {
    contract_detail: ContractDetail,
    data_of_births: DataTime<Utc>,
}

struct Word {                      struct World {
    persons: Vec<Person>,  =>           contract_details: Vec<ContractDetail>,
}                                       data_of_births: Vec<DataTime<Utc>>,
                                   }

when iterator person, to do calcuation, normally one function only need part of 
the attributes of persion, but whole persion is fetched in the cache, which make
the cache line missing more probable.
EC arch, merge all the attributes of component into world using vection, and use
save all the components as a vector of ids, and use the id to fetch the related
attirbutes from the world(a container for all the attributes)
