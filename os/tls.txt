thread specific context in linux == TCB (thread control block) == struct pthread == TLS (thread local storage)
has specific regisiter(FS) to point to 

TLS is setup by ld.so

TLS implementation requires compiler, linker, kernel and language runtime.

ELF
.data    initialized data 
.bss     uninitialized data
.tdata   thread local initialized data
.tbss    thread local uninitialized data

unlike normal section, thread local section willn't be used directly.

each object(static, dynmaic lib) could add value to TLS


regisiter point to TCB
TCB has point to a array == [dtv, dtv ...]
dtv == dynamic thread vector
