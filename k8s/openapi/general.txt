OpenAPI is a specification for describing REST APIs. 
With OpenAPI, you have set of JSON objects, with a specific schema 
that defines their naming, order, and contents. 
This JSON file (often expressed in YAML instead of JSON) describes 
each part of your API. By describing your API in a standard format, 
publishing tools can programmatically ingest the information about 
your API and display each component in a stylized, interactive display.


Swagger editor(http://editor.swagger.io/) is the GUI tool to write the
api specification

Swagger also offer a variaty of libraries (https://swagger.io/swagger-codegen/) 
which could be add to programming code to generate specification document.
