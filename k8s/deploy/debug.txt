old version ---> ingress ---> network & DNS ---> resource pressure ---> multi-tenancy
old version:
    changelog on k8s and core component
    CVEs
    test upgrades extensively
    automate upgrades


ingress:
    nginx IC
    separate controller
    chaos testing

network & DNS:
    monitor network health
    monitor DNS latency
    check for known issues

resource management
    protect k8s and critical addons
    add buffer node

multi-tenancy:
    separate and isolate namespaces with RBAC
    no cluster-admins
    separate clusters if possible
    automate with CI/CD

best practices
    preemptive monitoring & alerting are key
    logging and tracing help debug
    have a postmortem process



dev --> stage --> production

reserve enough resources for kubelet and system daemons
    --kube-reserved --kube-reserved-cgroup
    --system-reserved --system-reserved-cgroup
evict pressure pod early

HA api-server/controller/scheduler ?
