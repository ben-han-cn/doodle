serving -- request driven compute taht can scale to zero
build   -- source-to-container build orchestration
eventing -- management and delivery of events


resources
service: creates route and configuration
route:   map a network endpoint to one or more revisions
configuration: mutable desired state for deployment, each modification creating a new revision
revision: immutable point-in-time snapshot



eventing:
    loose coupling between event producers and consumers
    composable flows across independently scaling components
    pluggable message middleware provisioners
    pluggable event source provisioners


resources:
flow:    high level resource
source:  emits events to a channel
channel: event transport, typically backed by a message system
subscription: registers an interest in a channel on behalf of an app/function
