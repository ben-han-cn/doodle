use annotation to represent status of resource
to avoid multi component update the same attribute
    atomic attribute should has only one updator
    use resource version to avoid concurrent update composite structure
    use annotation key to notify unique owner
    use more annotation key/status to enforce order
    

resourceVersion is changed on every write.
since object is big, it has metadata, spec and status. Some controller
only care spec change, so it use generation to notify that spec is changed.
and use observedGeneration to persist the generation that was last acted on.
