security in general:
+ defense in depth
+ least privilege
+ limiting the attack surface


api server 
kubelet 
close insecure port, in v1.10 insecure port is deprecated
only authorized user can access, --anonymous-auth=false.

The Center for Internet Security 
    CIS Benchmark for Kubernetes
    CIS Benchmark for Docker

Penetration Testing
     kube-hunter

security image:
    scan image, detect vulnerable code
    rescan in regular base
    
kube-bench: CIS(center of internet security) k8s benchmark
    a list of tests to ensure basic best practices
    
image assurance: ensure only approved images can run in k8s environment

user asscess control

runtime protection: 
    ensure container only have the minimum privileges and capabilities they
need to funciton and blocks attempted attacked.

container firewall
    inter-container firewall rules to enforce segmentation.


best practice:
RBAC
protect api server
network policy
    allow specified pod access related db, etc
host os security for container
    runAsUser: 1000
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
    allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
use pod security policy


api server:
    authentication --> authorization --> mutating admission --> object vadliation ---> validating admission --> etcd
