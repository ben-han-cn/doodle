  apparmor profile
  Apparmor is a security framework that prevents applications from turning evil. 
  For example: If I run Firefox and visit a bad site that tries to install 
  malware that will delete my home folder, Apparmor has limits on Firefox though 
  preventing it from doing anything I don't want (like accessing my music, 
  documents, etc). This way even if your application is compromised, no harm 
  can be done.
