node has taint
pod has toleration

if toleration match taint, pod could be scheduled into the node
taint:
  key,value,effect

effects:
  PreferNoSchedule //if has other node, this node is avoid by scheduler
  NoSchedule    // pod won't scheduled to the node
  NoExecute //pod will be evicted from the node


$ kubectl taint node node1.k8s node-type=production:NoSchedule
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
 name: prod
spec:
 replicas: 5
 template:
 spec:
 ...
 tolerations:
 - key: node-type
   Operator: Equal
   value: production
   effect: NoSchedule
//the toleration make the pod could be scheduled to node1.k8s

//the following spec is more generic
tolerations:
-operator: Exists
 effect: NoExecute
-operator: Exists
 effect: NoSchedule

//untaint the node
kubectl taint nodes node1.k8s key:NoSchedule-


taints are a way to repel intolerant pods.
node can have several taints
pod can have several tolerations
if node has several taints, and the pod has to meet every taint to be
scheduled to that node
