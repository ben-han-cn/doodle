container process
    kernel task structure
        cgroups

        security capabilities
        scheduling entity


resources
    cpu
    memory
    ephemeral storage
    ...


for each resources, Requests(R) and Limits(L) can be specified
    those are specified at the container level
    only CPU, Memory and ephemeral-storage allow for overcommitment (limit >= request)
    they are read only after creation.

sysctl
    In Linux, the sysctl interface allows an administrator to modify kernel parameters 
at runtime. Parameters are available via the /proc/sys/ virtual process file system. 
    A number of sysctls are namespaced in todayâ€™s Linux kernels. This means that they 
can be set independently for each pod on a node. Only namespaced sysctls are configurable 
via the pod securityContext within Kubernetes.


Resource Quota admission controller
Default requests/limits ---> limitRanger admission controller


scheduler:
allocatable < node capacity


node:
cgroups are used to map Pod CPU and Memory resources.

eviction order (1.9 and above):
    usage > requests -> pod priority -> usage - request


node resources reverse with labels/selectors


language runtime has no cgroup aware, which make them see all the resources on the host
which could make bad tunning decision, use configmap to pass the parameter will be a 
good idea.
