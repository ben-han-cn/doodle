    an AdmissionRequest, which has
        a UID
        a Raw Extension carrying full json payload for an object, such as a Pod
        And other stuff that you may or may not use
Based on this information you apply your logic and you return a new AdmissionReview
The AdmissionReview contains an
    AdmissionResponse which has
        the original UID from the AdmissionRequest
        A Patch (if applicable)
        The Allowed field which is either true or false
