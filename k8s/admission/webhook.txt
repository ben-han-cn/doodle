Admission controllers are powerful tools for intercepting requests to the
k8s API server prior to persistence of the object.

Admission controller is built into api-server, so external admission webhooks are
protomoted as a solution to address this limitation. External Admission Webhooks
are split into MutationgAdmissionWebhook and ValidatingAdmissionWebhook.

webhooks to create additional mutating and validating admission plugins to admission chain
of apiserver without recompiling them. This provides developers with the freedom and flexibility
to customize admission logic on multiple actions like CREATE, UPDATE, and Delete on any resource.
Some common use case include:
1 Mutating resources before creating them. Istio inject a envoy sidecar containers to target pod.
2 Automated provisioning of StorageClass
3 Validating complex custom resource. Make sure custom resource can only be created after its definition
and all dependencies created and available.
4 Restricting namespace. On multi-tenant systems, avoid resources created in reversed namespaces.

workflow:
1 register hook to apiserver using MutatingWebhookConfiguration. in the configuration including:
how to connect to the server
how to verify the server
the url path of the server
rule defining which resource and waht action it handles
how unrecognized errors from the server are handled

2 enable MutationgAdmissionWebhook which is a plugin of admission controller for aip server
3 webhook admission server
a plain http server
follow the api
get AdmissionReview from MutationgAdmissionWebhook and response with AdmissionResponse



Kubernetes submits an AdmissionReview to your webhook, containing
    an AdmissionRequest, which has
        a UID
        a Raw Extension carrying full json payload for an object, such as a Pod
        And other stuff that you may or may not use
Based on this information you apply your logic and you return a new AdmissionReview
The AdmissionReview contains an
    AdmissionResponse which has
        the original UID from the AdmissionRequest
        A Patch (if applicable)
        The Allowed field which is either true or false
