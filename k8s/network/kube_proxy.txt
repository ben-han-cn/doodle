kube-proxy is the process to manipulate each node's iptable
for service with cluster ip 10.104.154.139
$sudo iptables-save |grep KUBE | grep `service-name`
.....

any pkt come from the pod CIDR destined for the service clusterip
on service port will be redirect, randomly, to one of the downstream
pods (end points) select by the label.


headless service has no clusterip, in this case, kube-proxy will 
do nothing. and the service is exposed through DNS
