PersistentVolume 
    low level representation of a storage volumn
    consumable resource 
    have independent lifecycle from the pod use it
    atomic unit cann't be split or used partially

Volume
    a directory, possibly with some data in it
    accessible to containers in a pod
    has same lifecycle with pod using it
    Volume is the storage used directly by pod
    inline volume: 
        normally is local ephemeral volumes, 
        referred to directly in pod spec (without pv/pvc)
        emptyDir, config map, downward api, secret and projected

Volume Driver
    code to communicate with the backend storage provider
    decide the medium and content for a volume

PersistentVolumeClaim
    the binding between a pod and PersistentVolume
    one-to-one exclusive binding with PersistentVolume

Storage class
    dynaimc provisioning of PersistentVolume
    provisioning == create and initialize it


how a pod get storage:
1 volume
2 static pv
3 dynamic pv
4 VolumeClaimTemplate Way (in statefulset)
  pod name and pvc name is perdictable
  when scale down, pod will be deleted, but the pvc will be retained
  when scale up, new pod will use old pvc.
5 Flexvolume and CSI, third party implementation. 
    

Controllers and Kubelets
Kubernetes has a number of controllers that run on the masters, monitor the 
state of the cluster and initiate actions in response to events.

It also runs a kubelet process on all of the worker nodes. The kubelet stays 
in constant contact with the controllers, submitting metrics about current 
running pods and listening for new instructions.

Kubelet:
- Mount and format new PersistentVolumes that are scheduled to this host
- Start containers with PersistentVolume hostpath mounted inside the container
- Stop containers and unmount the associated PersistentVolume
- Constantly send metrics to the controllers about container & PersistentVolume state

Controller:
- to match a PersistentVolumeClaim to a PersistentVolume
- to dynamically provision a new PersistentVolume if a claim cannot be met (if enabled)
    in the case of EBS this is done via the AWS api from the masters
- to attach the backend storage to a specific node if needed
    in the case of EBS this is done via the AWS api from the masters
- to instruct the kubelet for a node to mount (and potentially format) the volume
this is done on the actual node
- to instruct the kubelet to start a container that uses the volume
The kubelet itself performs the low-level mount and mkfs commands when instructed by 
the controller.


PV (PersistentVolume.spec.Class)
PVC (PersistentVolume.spec.Class)
steps:
1 admin create the storage class
2 pvc is specify the storage class
3 pvc.Annotations["volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-provisioner"] = storageClass.Provisioner
4 in tree
    ProvisionableVolumePlugin --> NewProvisioner --> Provision(storageClassObj) -> no error
    controller create the pv and set pv.Spec.Class to pvc.Spec.Class

  out of tree
    controller couldn't find ProvisionableVolumePlugin with specified storage class, it do nothing
    external provisioner watch the pvc
        pvc.Annotations["volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-provisioner"] == its name
        pvc.Spec.VolumeName == ""
        find the storage class resource 
        use the attribute value in storage class, pvc.Spec.Selector to provision the volume 
        create the pv
            pv.Annotations["pv.kubernetes.io/provisioned-by"] = provisioner's name
            pv.Annotations["volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class"] = pvc.Spec.Class
            pv.Spec.PersistentVolumeSource ==> created storage asset
            pv.Spec.PersistentVolumeReclaimPolicy = delete 

pv delete
    pv.Status.Phase = Released
    controller looks for pv.Annotations["pv.kubernetes.io/provisioned-by"], if found, it use provisioner/deleter 
    if not, controller inspects pv.Spec to find in-tree deleter
    use the deleter to delete the storage assets 

    for external provisioner
        watch for PV changes. When pv.Status.Phase == Released && 
            pv.Annotations['pv.kubernetes.io/provisioned-by'] == <deleter name>
        ignore pv.Spec.PersistentVolumeReclaimPolicy != delete
        after delete the storage assets, it delete the pv
