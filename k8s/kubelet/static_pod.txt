pod which is directly created and managed by kubelet is static pod.
k8s api server has no idea about it. but kubelet will create mirror
pod for each static pod, in this way, k8s dashboard could display 
static pod, but api server couldn't manage mirror pod.


select a folder ---> /etc/kubernetes/manifests
set parameter to kubelet ---> --pod-manifest-path=/etc/kubernetes/manifests 
                              --sync-frequency 30s
restart kubelet
