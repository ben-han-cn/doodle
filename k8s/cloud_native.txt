cloud native infrastructure is infrastructure that is hidden
behind useful abstractions, controlled by APIs, managed by
software, and has the purpose of running applications.

cloud native application is engineered to run on a platform
and is designed for resiliency, agility, operability and 
observability.

Resiliency embrace failures instead of trying to prevnet them.
Agility allows for fast deployment and quick iteration
Operability adds control of application life cycles from inside 
the application
Observability provides information to answer questions about 
application state.


Microservice vs Monoliths
As complexity of applicaiton grows, Monoliths becomes hard to 
understand and modify.  Modularity is the way to fight the complexity.
And use different service to implement module is the effective
enforcement of principle of API dependency.
It make the application much esaier to modify and grow in parallel.

Application should provide the state info for platform to manage it.
the state(life cycle state) including:
    ready 
    healthy
    error

Telemetry data
    SLI == service-level indicator
    KPI == key performance indicator
    Rate, Errors, Duration(Latency)
it mostly used to alert or history tracing
