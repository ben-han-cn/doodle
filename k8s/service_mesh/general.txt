Dedicated infrastructure layer for adding reliability, security, visibility to a cloud native applicaiton by managing all the runtime service communication. It provides circuit breaking, request routing, security policy etc. 

conduit design specifically for k8s
control plan
data plan
  proxy
    service -> proxy -------> proxy -> service
    monitoring:
      latency
      success/failure rate
      request per second (volumn)
      caller and callee relationship



why serivce mesh:
bloated service code
duplicating work to make services production-ready
    load balancing, auto scaling, rate limit, traffic routing
inconsistency across services
    retry, tls, failover for each language framework
    policy and debugging
diffusing responsibility of service management


observability
    logging, metrcis, tracing
traffic control
    resiliency, effiency, security, policy
