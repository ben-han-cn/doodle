service catalog
ClusterServiceBroker  ----> Services they could provide descirbed by ClusterServiceClass
user want service ----> create ServiceInstance + ServiceBinding ----> bind service to their pods


register the broker, url will specify the service endpoint
apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterServiceBroker
metadata:
 name: database-broker
spec:
 url: http://database-osbapi.myorganization.org

the broker server needs to implement the interface:
Retrieving the list of services with GET /v2/catalog
Provisioning a service instance (PUT /v2/service_instances/:id)
Updating a service instance (PATCH /v2/service_instances/:id)
Binding a service instance (PUT /v2/service_instances/:id/service_bindings/:binding_id)
Unbinding an instance (DELETE /v2/service_instances/:id/service_bindings/:binding_id)
Deprovisioning a service instance (DELETE /v2/service_instances/:id)

Service Catalog in k8 will get all the service the broker provides through the
first interface, and then it will create all the ClusterServiceClass resource for each of them
