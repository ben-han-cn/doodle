fundamental: solve linear equation.
    2x - y  = 0
    -x + 2y = 3

row picture
    2x - y = 0   ----> line 1
    -x + 2y = 3  ----> line 2

column picture
         2          -1       0
    x  [    ] + y [    ] = [   ]
         -1          2       3
    linear combination of columns ==> vector 

matrix view
    2  -1     x       0
  [       ] [   ] = [   ]
    -1  2     y       3


Ax = b ---> b is a combination of columns of A
  2  5     1         2         5       12
[      ] [   ] = 1 [   ] + 2 [   ] = [    ]
  1  3     2         1         3       7

for every b if there is a x, it means the linear combination of
n dimensional vector in matrix A will fill the while n dimensional 
space

Matrix x col == col == ( col_e1 * matrix_col1 + col_e2 * matrix_col2 + ....) ==> col plus
row x Matrix == row == ( row_e1 * matrix_row1 + row_e2 * matrix_row2 + ....) ==> row plus


elimination (could be succeed or failure)

1 2 1     2 
3 8 1     12
0 4 1     2
(1, 1) ---> pivot
(2, 2) ---> pivot, pivot cann't be zero, when zero pivot met, we should 
do line position transform.
pivot is the diagonal line of the matrix, the elimination is to
make all the element under the diagonal line to be zero, and when
elimination is done, from row picture, the dimensional of the last
row will be one and each upper row will be one more dimensional than
the lower row ---> 

lower level line - n * upper level line
1 2 1         1 2 1
3 8 1   --->  0 2 -2
0 4 1         0 0 5

2       2
12  --> 6
2       -10
