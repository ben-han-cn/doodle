Perceprons
Take several binary inputs and produces a single binary output.
A method for weighing evident to make decision.
          0  if w * x + b <= 0
output =  
          1  if w * x + b > 0

x -> input
w -> weight
b -> bias

learning = automatically tune the weight and biases of a network of 
arificial neurons.

small change in weight(or bias) to cause only a small corresponding
changes in the output from the network. this property will make learning
possible.

Sigmoid neurons
same structure with Perceprons, except 
input is in range(0, 1)
output is generate use another equation

sigmoid neurons use a different equation to calcuate the output, the equation
have the property that samll change in x and w, will has small affect on 
the output.
