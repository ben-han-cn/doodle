machine learning == figuring out an equation to solve a specific problem based on some example data

deep learning: a technique for implementing machine learning
deep neural networks(DNN) is one kind of deep learning, DNN is where the code structures you write are arranged in layers that loosely mimic the human brain, learning patterns of patterns.

features/attributes
unbiased tranning data

supervised learning: learn from labelled data set and the system is told what
the expected output label is

unsupervised learning: learn from unlabelled data set

reinforcement learning: program learns by playing the game millions of times, we
reward the program when it makes a good move, when it loses we give no reward or 
nagative reward.
