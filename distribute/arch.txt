software == control plane + data plane
control plane usually more complicate than data plan

control plane for cloud:
    manage the life cycle of the resources
    provision software
    provision service configuration
    provision user configuration


control theory => close loop
    desired state
    acture state
    measure between state/ correction between states / take actions 


PID controller (a proportional-integral-derivative controller)
continuously calculates an error value as the difference between a desired setpoint(SP) 
and a measured process value(PV) and applies a correction based on proportional, integral and
derivative terms.


patterns:
1 Checksum all of the things
2 Cryptographic Authentication
3 Cells, Shells, and Poison Tasters
4 Asynchronous Coupling
5 Closed Feedback Loops
6 Small pushes and large pulls
7 avoid cold start if cacheing lay is very expensive, self warming instead
8 throttles and rate-limits
9 use deltas, efficent to compute deltas and distribute deltas
10 modality and constant-work
