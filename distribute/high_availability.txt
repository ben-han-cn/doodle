1 active-passive
active serve all the read and write
active sync data to passive
when active crash, redirect traffic to passive
virtual ip address could be used to automate the traffic redirect.

2 Sharding
distribute work load to different host based on key schema
each host own part of the cluster data, and some host as the 
backup for this part data.
meta server to control the traffic base on key

3 consensus replication (raft)
leader handle all the write
leader sync data to majority follower
when leader crash, new leader will be selected.
client can interact with any node, and write will be forward to leader
muliti-raft == raft + sharding
