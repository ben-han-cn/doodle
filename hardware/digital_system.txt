abstraction:
appliation -> os -> architecture(ISA) -> micro-architecture -> logic
-> digital circuits -> analog circuits -> device -> physics


three-y to management complexity:
Hierarchy:  divide and conque
Modularity: well-defined interface
Regularity:  uniformity

supply voltage == Vdd. 5v -> 3.3v -> ... -> 1.2v
logic level: 
    valid zone (range) of input voltage to produce predicatable one or zero
noise margins:
    circuit toleration of outside interruption
logic family:
    define the valid voltage input which will produce valid logic output
    TTL/CMOS/LVTTL/LVCMOS (later one has lower Vdd)

logic gate == electrically controlled switch

each digital circuit is a black box, with functional and time sepcification.
Time sepcification consists of lower and upper bounds on the delay from input
to output.

The timing specification of a combinational circuit consists of the propagation
and contamination delays through the circuit. These indicate the longest and
shortest time between an input change and the consequent output change. Calculating
the propagation delay of a circuit involves identifying the criticial path 
throught the circuit, then adding up the propagation delays of each element
along the path.

circult design:
FSM
state encoding

clock
The clock period has to be long enough for all signals to settle. This sets a limit
on the speed of the system.
