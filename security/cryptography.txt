The fundamental building block of most modern cryptography is a one-way function. 
A one-way function is a function that is easy to compute, but its inverse is hard 
to compute. (i.e. given f(x) = y, it is easy to calculate y given x, but to very hard
to calculate x given y)
There are two main ways that this is done:
1 Factorization
2 Elliptic Curve Logarithms
