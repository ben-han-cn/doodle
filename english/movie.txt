That scene is really the moment, I think, that the audience
is completely disengaged from the humans.

So that's why I think filmmakers sometimes have to play tricks
when they portray aliens, to give them humanlike features, in 
order to evoke that kind of feeling of empathy from us.

It was so clean and pristine, it almost hurt your eys because 
the edges are so sharp, and it's giant. 

All of these different stories, they all had a social message 
buried in them. Look, We can do better. Things, the way they
are, it's not necessarily the way they have to be.

What I took from the ortiginal series was the love humanity is
able to have, even if it's set in a time that they may never 
recognize, they may never meet, the strive for that is tangible.
