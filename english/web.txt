In general, only static languages are amenable to AOT compilation into 
native machine code because machine languages typically need to know the 
type of data, and in dynamic languages the type is not fixed ahead of time. 
Consequently, dynamic languages are typically interpreted or JIT compiled.

The uses of this machine is manifold.
