a computer is a device that reads, modifies and writes sequences of numbers.

basic component:
1 ALU(arithmetic logic unit) 
    data input
    code input
    result output

2 Storage
    register are arrayed in a storage structure called register file
    memory

3 Bus

Instruction:
    Arithmetic instruction
    Memory access instruction
        absolute addressing
        register-relative addressing
    branch instruction
        processor status word(PSW) register

pipeline:
    each instruction execution time isn't changed
    but they will overlapped, make the programm execution time shrinked 
    dramatically
    a x stage pipeline yield a x times speed up
