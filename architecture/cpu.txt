a computer is a device that reads, modifies and writes sequences of numbers.

basic component:
1 ALU(arithmetic logic unit) 
    data input
    code input
    result output
(ALU is in charge of two kind of operation: arithmetic and logic, logic operation
including and/or/bit shift/bit rotate)

2 Storage
    register are arrayed in a storage structure called register file
    memory

3 Bus

Instruction:
    Arithmetic instruction
    Memory access instruction
        absolute addressing
        register-relative addressing
    branch instruction
        processor status word(PSW) register

pipeline:
    each instruction execution time isn't changed
    but they will overlapped, make the programm execution time shrinked 
    dramatically
    a x stage pipeline yield a x times speed up


Superscalar == more than one ALU but share register file


data category for ALU:
1 integer
  floating point
2 scalar
  vector
therefore, there are four type of input for ALU:
    integer scalar, floating scalar, integer vector, floating point vector

EU(execution unit) is a general component, modern cpu use different EU to do different things, 
ALU, LSU(load-store unit), BEU(branch execution unit)
