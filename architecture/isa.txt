ISA(instruction set architecture) is the abstraction
CPU exposed to programmer

A particular processor's hardware implementation of an ISA
is generally referred to as the processor's microarchitecture.
Sometimes microarchitecture change is invisible to programmer, 
superscalar is one example. But some microarchitecture change 
leads to ISA extension, like FPU and MMX (which is used to process
vector).

microcode engine
    microcode ROM which store microcode progrmas, and an execution
unit, the job of microcode program is to translate a particular 
instruction into a series of machine instructions. By decoding instructions
this way, all programs are effectively running in emulation by underlaying
hardware.

RISC(reduced instruction set computing) simpfied the ISA, when ISA is
simple enough, that they could be decode directly by hardware to remove the
microcode engine.
