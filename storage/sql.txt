An index is a distinct structure in the database that is built using the create 
index statement. It requires its own disk space and holds a copy of the indexed 
table data. That means that an index is pure redundancy. Creating an index does 
not change the table data; it just creates a new data structure that refers to 
the table. A database index is, after all, very much like the index at the end 
of a book: it occupies its own space, it is highly redundant, and it refers to 
the actual information stored in a different place.

Searching in a database index is like searching in a printed telephone directory. 
The key concept is that all entries are arranged in a well-defined order. Finding 
data in an ordered data set is fast and easy because the sort order determines 
each entry's position.

The database combines two data structures to meet the challenge: a doubly linked 
list and a search tree. These two structures explain most of the database's 
performance characteristics.
