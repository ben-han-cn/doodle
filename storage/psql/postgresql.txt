             indexes
             views
             functions
             sequences
             ..

database and all it contains are object, with a object identifier(OID).
physicall, object is stored in files, and file name is based on OID. 

table file:
blocks(8k pages)
  page(block)
    header, line pointers, space, tuples
    (tuple is added from bottom to top, and pointers is the offsets, so
     tuple could be index by (block index, offset))
