user rw -->  sharedbuff --> os cache --> disk

sharedbuffer
    psql handle data in block(8k)
        emp table with one record;
        SELECT pg_relation_filepath('emp');
        base/24741/24742  --> 8192 bytes = 8K
    write normaly only change the buffer, and write to WAL, 
    

checkpoint
    a process to sync the data(record, index) between mem and disk
    the basic unit to sync is block/page, and normally with 8k size
    
    checkpoint will run when any condition is met:
    checkpoint_timeout period has elapsed
    checkpoint_segments nubmer of WAL have been filled

    longer checkpoint interval may cause io spikes which will affect
    the query performance.

    checkpoint_completion_target tells psql how quickly it must try and finish
    the sync in each iteration. with default value of 0.5, psql can be exepected
    to finish the sync using half of the interval.

    At checkpoint time, all dirty data pages are flushed to disk and a
    special checkpoint record is written to the log file.


WAL:
    write --> WAL buffer
    commit --> sync to WAL segments, (each WAL segment is 16M)

    wal_level decides the amount of information written to WAL
    minimal: only support crash recovery
    archive: archive WAL to support point-in-time recovery
    hot_standby: run readonly queries on a standby server.

background writer:
writing to disk specific dirty buffers based on an algorithm, whereas checkpointer
write all dirty buffers. It ensure that thera are available buffers in shared buffer
for new data to fulfill read requirement.

vacuum:
    remove dead record which created for MVCC

logger:
    logging_collector = on
    log level:
        INFO
        NOTICE
        WARNING
        ERROR
        LOG
        FATAL
        PANIC

stats collector
    \d pg_stat
    //when memory isn't enough, psql will use tmp file to implement some operation. 
    SELECT temp_files, temp_bytes FROM pg_stat_database WHERE datname = 'postgres';

WAL send and receive


other mem:
    work_mem --> for sort operation
    maintenance_work_mem --> for vacuum
