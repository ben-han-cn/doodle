logically:
postgres --> databases
database --> tables
             indexes
             views
             functions
             sequences
             ..

database and all it contains are object, with a object identifier(OID).


physicall:
object is stored in files, and file name is based on OID. 
base directory: $PGDATA
$PGDATA
    base                per-database subdirectories
    global              cluster-wide tables, like pg_database and pg_control
    pg_tblspc           symbolic links to tablespaces 
    pg_wal              WAL(write ahead logging) segment files
    pg_xact             transaction commit state data

    pg_hba.conf         control client authentication
    postgresql.conf     configuration parameters

table file:
blocks(8k pages)
  page(block)
    header, line pointers, space, tuples
    (tuple is added from bottom to top, and pointers is the offsets, so
     tuple could be index by (block index, offset))

(block number, offset) ---> line pointer --> heap tuples (record data)
