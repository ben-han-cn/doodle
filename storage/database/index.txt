index
    is pure redundancy. 
    it doesnot change the table data, but create a new data structure that refers to 
    the table. 
    it refers to the actual information stored in a different place.
    implementation:
        double linked list -- sorted and easy to modify 
        balance tree



double linked list to store leaf node:
struct 
    node (indexed-column, row-id)
    prev 
    next

B+ tree for quick search the leaf node.

index lookup:
    travel tree
    follow leaf node chain(same column key)
    fetch the table data
